         <h4 class= 'hoe-hoe-hoe'>Is there a logical explaination?.</p>  
<h1 class='hoe-hoe-hoe'> Here's how... </p>
        <h4 class= 'hoe-hoe-hoe'>According to cbs news, 53% of twitter users hear Laurel while the rest hear Yanny. 
          It's all a matter of frequency. A higher pitched, nasal voice causes people to hear "Yanny", and a lower, more masculine voice causes others to hear "Laurel". Accordinng to Lars Riecke, assistant professor in cognitive neuroscience at Maastricht University, part of the reason of the two outcomes had to do with the sound itself, but another part of the reason is what you're expecting to hear when someoe asks if you hear "Yanny" or "Laurel".</p>
